# Darkorbit Umbrella

An experimental Elixir/OTP and Phoenix space-MMO server. The server is being
built as an authoritative game system: clients submit intentions, while
identity, ownership, inventory, equipment, progression, economy, and world
state are validated and owned by the server.

The current completed baseline stabilizes account registration and the
persistent player-state domains. It is not yet a playable game client; the
next vertical slices are the ship-stat engine and authoritative world runtime.

## Requirements

- Elixir 1.15 or newer with a compatible Erlang/OTP release
- PostgreSQL 14 or newer
- A local `postgres` role with password `postgres` for the checked-in
  development and test configuration, or equivalent local config overrides

Production reads `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `POOL_SIZE`, `PORT`, and
optionally `ECTO_IPV6` from the environment. Never commit production secrets.

## Development

From the umbrella root:

```console
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

The setup alias fetches dependencies, creates and migrates `darkorbit_dev`,
and installs/builds the browser assets. Open <http://localhost:4000> after the
server starts.

Useful commands:

```console
mix test
mix precommit
mix hex.audit
```

`mix precommit` compiles with warnings treated as errors, removes unused lock
entries, formats the project, and runs the complete umbrella test suite. The
test aliases create and migrate `darkorbit_test` automatically. Run
`mix hex.audit` before releases to check the locked Hex packages against current
retirements and security advisories.

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for application boundaries,
transaction invariants, the audited baseline, and the next implementation
milestone. The longer-term direction is tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
